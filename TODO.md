# TODO
I have been thinking about some ideas for the tic tac toe project and I am considering two parts. 

The first idea that I had, was to have the  second player play strategically while the first player is playing randomly. This would require having the places on the tic tac toe board assigned to a number so that player 1 draws a random number off the board. I would need R to be able to track what spots on the board are still available. I will do my research to find out this think on R. I will record every step and trail to track my results and goals. I am really so intersted to start this project and working to get results.

The second part could be to have both players playing randomly where their spots are assigned to them randomly. Then I would simulate this 100 times and find the proportion of wins when the winner started in the middle. I could also check to see the proportion of wins when the winner started in the corners and when they started in the other spots.


In this week I will spend my time in researching and trying some code for starting the game on R. Also, I will figure out function can help me to track the spot theat alresdy has been chosen. 

Next week(6th), I will start simulating and working more on the code. By week 7 I would like to have completed the first part of my project which is when the second player is strategic.

Then by week 8 I would like to try the second part of the project which is when both players play randomly.
